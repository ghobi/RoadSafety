### Aim

The aim of this project was to use imagery to estimate safety on the roads of London, from a cyclist’s perspective. After
a brief introduction to the most important road safety indicators, a ranked list with several risk factors was compiled.
Risk factors were obtained from Google StreetView (GSV) imagery dataset using the object detection YOLOv5 (released in June 2020 by Glenn Jocher) and
image segmentation PSPNet101 (Pyramid Scene Parsing Network) (released in July 2017 by Hengshuang Zhao et al.).

Imagery dataset contains 518 350 images of greater London, distributed across 4833 boroughs. Each image is labeled in accordance
to the LSOA it belongs. Images are organized in sets of 4 which corresponds to 4 90º angles from a total of 129 588 points.

Both YOLOv5 and PSPNet101 were benchmarked and validated using a set of 1 image per LSOA from the dataset.

Data was storage and processed in the secure High Performance Cluster from Imperial College London.

### GSV Dataset

#### Description

Along this project, it was used a Google StreetView imagery dataset from Greater London. It includes, approximately,
1/2 million images distributed across all LSOAs. For each data point there are 4 images ranging from 0º to 360º. These
images were previously pre-processed (not as part of this project) to guarantee uniformity across them. More details
are provided below.

#### Number of Images per LSOA in Greater London

Knowing the number of available images per LSOA allows us to normalize the objects counting in each area.

![](./img/imagery_dataset/number_images.png)

#### Distribution by Latitude and Longitude of All Image Locations

There is an higher density of GSV images in Central London.

![](./img/imagery_dataset/images_distribution.png)

#### Example of Data Point with 4 Images Covering 360º Angle

Each image per data point covers a 90º degrees angle.

![](./img/imagery_dataset/gsv_img_angles.png)

img_id = 23052

#### Number of Available Images per LSOA in the Dataset

Distribution stats on the availability of GSV images across Greater London LSOAs.

Minimum | Maximum | Mean | Standard Deviation | Mode | Median
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
1 | 211 | 27 | 24 | 25 | 11

#### Total Number of Available Images in the Complete GSV Dataset

Not all images present in the GSV imagery dataset are LSOA labeled. For this reason, only 478 724 of the 518 350 were
used when performing object detection or image segmentation.

Number Images in GSV Dataset | Number of LSOA identified Images (image_labels.csv) | Number of Non-Repeated LSOA identified Images (image_labels.csv) | Number of Image Identified LSOAs (image_labels.csv)

### Object Detection | [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)

#### Description

YOLOv5 is the most recent version of YOLO which was originally developed by Joseph Redmon. First version runs in a framework
called Darknet which was purposely built to execute YOLO.

Version 5 is the 2nd model which was not developed by Joseph Redmon (after version 4) and the first running in the
state-of-the-art machine learning framework, in this case, PyTorch.

This model was pre-trained using Coco dataset. Thus, it is able to identify 80 object categories. Distributed
over 11 categories.

#### YOLOv5 Executed in a Static Image from the Dataset

This example illustrates very well the power of this tool. Even the reflection of the car in a window nearby the algorithm
was able to count as the right object.

\* &#8593; and &#8595; were positively and negatively associated to road safety, respectively.

#### Combining Some of the Previous Risk Factors

It was combined 5 of the previous LSOAs to obtain a measure on the total number of pedestrians and cyclists in London (in the context
of this project, this was perceived as enhancing safety factor for other cyclists). And a second LSOA where the total number of (motorized) vehicles
in London was plotted.

Pedestrians and Cyclists in Greater London (average number per image) (&#8593;)          |  Traffic (buses, cars and trucks) in Greater London (average number per image) (&#8595;)

![](./img/yolov5/normalized_pedestrians_score.png)  |  ![](./img/yolov5/normalized_traffic_score.png)

#### Combination of the 2 Previous LSOAs

During this project, we did not defined a precise metric for assessing cyclist road safety. Although, one strong
possibility would be a weighted combination of positive and negative risk factors like the ones exposed by LSOA
distributions above.

#### GIF Representation of the 2 Most Correlated Objects

This GIF highlights the similar distribution between 1 of the 2 most correlated objects present in the correlation matrix above.

![](./img/yolov5/person_handbag.gif)

#### Top 15 Detected Objects Distribution

Top 15 detections contain all the objects that were defined as relevant in assessing road safety in a cyclist perspective.
One immediate observation is that the majority of the detected objects were cars. This is not surprising once GSV
images were taken from the road.

#### YOLOv5 Limitations

For all road objects we intended to identify, the accuracy rates were very high, with very few misclassifications due to the high detection threshold (0.5) it was set.
For this reason, the number of detected objects in the image is likely to be higher than the detected one.
In terms of other objects, satellite dishes were often misclassified as clocks. There is a strong resemblance in frontal images between
clock pointers and dishes arms. Boats were wrongly classified as construction containers due to their shape. Fences as benches presumably due to their texture. And
Streetlights as kites and frisbees, possible because they have similar backgrounds - sky.

#### Future Directions

Analysis of a significant set of GSV images in London unveiled meaningful LSOA level patterns. One is the
airplane distribution in the areas closer to the 2 airports in Greater London. Second, the presence of potted plants
was found to be more significant around the biggest parks.
This shows the potential of GSV imagery analysis is not limited to assess road safety.

### Image Segmentation | [PSPNet101](https://github.com/hellochick/PSPNet-tensorflow)

#### Description

Image segmentation models reached a precision plateau (in terms of average IoU) in the previous 2 years. Due to their
long execution times, it was chosen the model executing faster, with the higher precision and better documentation.

PSPNet101 was pre-trained in the Cityscapes dataset. This way, it was able to label all pixels from an image across 100
categories.

<details>

  <summary>Full list of Cityscapes categories</summary>

</details>

#### Example of a Segmented Image with Identified Labels Included

After executing PSPNet101 in one of the images from the dataset, we obtain a segmented one where all pixels have an associated color
accordingly to the category they belong. It was created a dictionary that links each one of these colors to the different
object categories.
![](./img/pspnet101/PSPNet101.png)

#### Segmented Images Distribution by Number of Pixels

Road safety related objects are among the most detected. Consequently, PSPNet101 pre-trained in Cityscapes is
an appropriate tool to extract relevant information on this topic.

![](./img/pspnet101/image_segmentation_distribution2.png)

#### Number of Labeled Pixels for the Top 20 Most Common Categories

Due to time constraints, contrarily to the object detection part, it was only possible to analyse the general presence
of pixel labels at a dataset (not LSOA) level.

Pixel Label            |  Number Pixels | Pixel Label            |  Number Pixels | Pixel Label            |  Number Pixels | Pixel Label            |  Number Pixels

#### PSPNet101 Limitations

The main difficulties of image segmentation are:
* Account for image angles when trying to capture the shape of an object;
* Object occlusion;
* Sometimes roads and sidewalks appear unexpectedly disrupted;
* Image resolution. In the case of structures with a small area (streetlights), it might not be possible to segment them due to
low resolution. This happens because the imagery dataset, which was extracted from GSV, did not keep the original
quality.

#### Generated Files

All the generated files are available on the project's repository or, in the case of the segmented images (1 per LSOA), in a linked
Google Drive folder.

#### Future Directions

1. Analysing segmented images road by road;
2. Having a higher resolution London imagery dataset with better coverage from all Greater London territory;
3. Link image segmentation analysis with the objects detected using YOLOv5;
4. Although this would not represent a significant improvement, using a more precise pre-trained model like Xception71
available in [TensorFlow DeepLab Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/g3doc/model_zoo.md) would
increase the quality of the segmented images.
